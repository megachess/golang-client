# golang-client
A newbie client for Megachess in Golang
# How to use
In order to use this client, you must set an env variable called MEGACHESS_AUTH_TOKEN, with the token provided when you logged-in
# Considerations
This client is yet very dummy and it chooses the table cells in a random fashion. Some logic will soon be added
